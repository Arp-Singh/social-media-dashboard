## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS3 custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- SASS (With mixins and file organization)
- Vanilla JS
- Gulp (For workflow and SASS mapping to CSS)
    - Node Modules included:
      - @babel/core & @babel/preset-env (works with autoprefixer to determine which properties get pre-fixed automatically)
      - postcss, autoprefixer, cssnano, dart-sass (Help minify css + supports new syntax @use and @forward)
      - browser-sync (Auto updates files when working in a live browser, no manual reload required)
      - gulp, gulp-babel, gulp-postcss, gulp-sass, gulp-terser (For SASS compiling and minify JS files)


### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```


### Continued development
Current plans going forward:
- Upon closer inspection, the dark mode toggle button looks more awkward in the mobile view. This should be changed to sit on the right hand side of the screen.
- Clean up the JavaScript file as there are a lot of 'if' statements and nested 'if' statements within it.
- Add in back-end functionality so that it may actually be used as a means of tracking social media metrics across different platforms. 


### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.example.com) - This helped me for XYZ reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.

**Note: Delete this note and replace the list above with resources that helped you during the challenge. These could come in handy for anyone viewing your solution or for yourself when you look back on this project in the future.**
